/* OBJECTS - JS type
           - Data Structure in JS
They consist of a property-value pairs and are 
assigned to a variable.

In arrays we used the [number] to acces a specific 
properties and their values stored in the array. With objects 
we use "variable.property"
Example using the code below:
*/

const userObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: "28",
  hobby: "code",
  isMarried: false,
};

/* 
userObject.name;
'John'
userObject.isMarried;
false
 */

/* 
Adding a property to an object or re-writing 
an existing value:

userObject.favouriteFood = "vegetables"

userObject.isMarried = true

 */
